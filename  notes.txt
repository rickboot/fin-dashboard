TypeScript
- Interface...

React
- useMemo
- useContext
- useReducer

Vite ('veet')
- like create-react-app -> webpack and babel?

Material UI
- ThemeContext
- can use css props in mui components
? why palette.grey[100] instead of palette.primary.grey[100] - because of TS module augmentation?

Emotion
- css lib

Folder structure
- What is the default react structure?


Redux
- predictable centralized state for javascript apps
- works on client, server, and native
- works with any ui layer and framework 
- easy to test and debug
- has large ecosystem of add-ons
- has libs for React - react-redux and redux toolkit

store is created via createStore (? configureStore)
- takes in reducer
 
reducer is created via combineReducers - 
- takes in a object of functions that run whenever dispatch is called
- the return value is the apps new state

dispatch 
- takes in type and item 

store is immutable
one way dataflow


action -> reducer -> store
   ^                   |
   |                   v
dispatch <- APP <- subscribe

mongoDB

mongoose
- use latest ^7

npm
- npm upgrade
- npm uninstall

cors issues
- remember app.use middleware are functions! - cors(), morgan(), helmet(), etc.
